# Asana Update Summarizer

A command-line tool to help you generate a summary of your work from Asana. It fetches tasks assigned to you that were modified in the last 7 days, interactively asks for a status and comment for each, and then generates a Markdown table of the tasks you've worked on.

## Features

-   Connects to your Asana account using a Personal Access Token.
-   Fetches your recently modified tasks.
-   Interactively prompts you to select which tasks you worked on.
-   Asks for a status and a comment for each selected task.
-   Optionally posts your comments back to Asana.
-   Generates a Markdown table of your work, perfect for daily stand-ups or reports.

## Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lewinnovation/asana-update-summarizer.git
    cd asana-update-summarizer
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

## Configuration

This tool requires an Asana Personal Access Token (PAT) to access your tasks. You can provide it in one of two ways:

1.  **Environment Variable (Recommended):**
    Set the `ASANA_PAT` or `ASANA_TOKEN` environment variable.
    ```bash
    export ASANA_PAT="your_personal_access_token"
    ```

2.  **Manual Input:**
    If the environment variable is not set, you will be prompted to enter your PAT when you run the script.

## Usage

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm start
```

The script will guide you through the following steps:
1.  It will ask for your Asana PAT if not already configured.
2.  It will fetch your workspaces and ask you to select one.
3.  It will find all your tasks in that workspace that have been modified in the last 7 days.
4.  For each task, it will ask you to confirm if you want to include it in your summary.
5.  If you include a task, it will ask for a `Status` and a `Comment`.
6.  It will ask if you want to post the comment back to the task in Asana.
7.  Finally, it will print a Markdown table to the console with the summary of your work.

## Example Output

Here is an example of the Markdown table generated by the tool:
